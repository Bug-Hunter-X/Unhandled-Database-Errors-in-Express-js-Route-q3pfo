# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database operations.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches user data but fails to handle potential database errors, leading to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling, using `try...catch` blocks to gracefully manage exceptions and return appropriate error responses to the client.
